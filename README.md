# Shortened URL Security

Shortened URLs, such as those from tinyurl.com, bit.ly and others  make it easy to type in a web address quickly but hard to tell where your web browser will actually take you.

* **Before clicking a shortened URL,** check for the full URL. Most URL shorteners include a preview feature. If you aren't sure it is safe, don't click!
* **Before creating or sharing a shortened URL,** consider alternatives. If you must use one, make clear where it goes.
* **Be aware** that criminals use shortened URLs to direct people to phishing sites and initiate malware downloads.

## Before You Click, Reveal Full URLs
There are a number of ways you can reveal the full URL behind a shortened URL:

* **Use the shortening service preview feature.** Type the shortened URL in the address bar of your web browser and add the characters described below to see a preview of the full URL:
  * **tinyurl.com.** Between the "https://" and the "tinyurl," type **preview**  
    Example: `https://preview.tinyurl.com/53j3s62p`  
  * **bit.ly.** At the end of the URL, type **+**  
    Example: `https://bit.ly/3PHKklI+`  

* **Use a URL checker.** These are just a few of the sites that let you enter a short URL and then see the full URL:
  * getlinkinfo.com
  * unshorten.it
  * urlxray.com

## How Criminals Use Shortened URLs
Criminals use shortened URLs to:

  * **Direct people to phishing websites,** sites that ask you to log in or fill in a form and then steal your password and/or personal information. Always Look Before You Log In.
  * **Initiate download of malicious software,** such as ransomware, to your device.

If you are suspicious of a shortened URL, don't click it.
